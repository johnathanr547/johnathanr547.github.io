# My Job Experiences
- **Research Intern**, United States Army Corps of Engineers, Geospatial Research Laboratory; Jun-Aug 2024, Dec 2024-Jan 2025\
As a research intern for USACE's Geospatial Research Laboratory, I worked in a team of 20 members conducting research into the optimization and use of AI models on smartphones for navigation in
  GPS-denied environments.
  
- **Teaching Assistant**, James Madison University Department of Computer Science; Aug 2024-Present\
As a teaching assistant at James Madison University, I provide assistance to professors during their class times, answering questions that students may have. Additionally, I also have office hours on Sundays where students can come in and have their questions answered. As a TA, I have been instructed in teaching methods to help students learn, understand, and comprehend their coursework, not just get the right answer.

# Coursework Projects
- **Fragile**, a mixed fraction calculator; Dec 2023\
Written as a part of CS345, Software Development with Dr. David Bernstein, myself and four other students worked together in a team to write Fragile. Written in Java utilizing Swing for GUI development, my team utilized the Scrum methodology, splitting our work into three two-week sprints. During the sprints, we decomposed requirements into tasks, provided time estimates, distributed the work among the team members, and met with the product manager (Dr. Bernstein) to negotiate the specifics of tasks. Personally, I worked on GUI elements, taking inputs from the user (specifically allowing the user to create custom keyboard shortcuts), custom layouts tailored for specific companies, and the saving and loading of program settings via serialization/de-serialization.

- **y86 Emulator**, an emulator of the fictional y86 architecture written in C; May 2024\
Written as a part of CS261, Computer Systems 1 with Dr. Mohamed Aboutabl, I wrote a program emulating a CPU implementing the fictional y86 architecture. During the course of this project, I implemented the fetch-decode-execute-update-writeback cycle implemented in modern CPU architectures. Written in four parts, my emulator could read CPU instructions as bytes from a file and execute them.

- **Unnamed Hotel Management Database**, a database with a webapp frontend written using PostgreSQL and Python; May 2024\
Written as a part of CS374, Databases with Dr. Chris Mayfield, I worked in a team with three other students to create a database and webapp for a fictional hotel chain. The frontend webapp was written in Python using Flask, and the database was implemented in PostgreSQL. During the course of the project, my team and I elicited the requirements of the database, created an ERD diagram for the database, created the databases, populated them with information, and then created the webapp to fulfill a wide variety of tasks related to the system.

- **Vex**, a spreadsheet application written in Ruby with a custom programming language; May 2025\
Written as a part of CS430, Programming Languages with Dr. Chris Johnson, I worked with a partner to create a spreadsheet program that uses it's own custom programming language. During the course of this project, my partner and I wrote an abstract syntax tree with abstractions for supported data types and operations, a parser, a lexer, support for custom variables and control flow, and a textual user interface using curses.

# Personal Projects
**Many of my personal projects are still in the prototyping and brainstorming stages, but I hope to get more of them completed and uploaded to my GitHub.**
- **Tortuga**, A simple turtle drawing program written in Java for education; In-progress\
The idea for this project is to create a drawing software that utilizes a simplified programming language to allow novice coders to get some experience with coding without knowing the syntax of a more complicated language. I plan to write the backend and UI in Java, and take the knowledge I've gained in CS430 about programming languages to write a very simple language to command the movement and drawing of the turtle. I also want to include a way for users to make localizations in other languages easily (Spanish, French, etc) through the creation of data files. This project is still in the brainstorming stages, but I hope to do more work on it and get a working prototype completed and published during the Summer of 2025.
- **Unnamed Music Store Database and Webapp**, a database for a music store written in PostgreSQL with a webapp frontend; In-progress\
I got the idea for this project while at my local music store. I found it really frustrating that they didn't have an online database of what they had in-stock, so I decided I should write my own database and webapp to solve this problem. This project is also still in the beginning stages; the database is mostly complete, but I haven't started on the webapp yet. I hope to have a working prototype completed and published to my GitHub by early Summer 2025.
