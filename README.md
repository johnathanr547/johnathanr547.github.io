# Welcome to my site!
**My name is John Ryder. I'm a junior computer science major/computer information systems minor at James Madison University.***
During my career as a computer scientist, I've gained experience in a wide variety of topics; here's some of them. Take a look!

# School-Related Projects:
**Fragile**, a mixed-fraction calculator written in Java.
  Fragile was written as a final project for CS345, software development with Dr. David Bernstein. To create Fragile, I worked
in a team with four other students in the class. To plan and execute our project, we utilized the Scrum methodology. Over a set
of three 2-week sprints, we understood requirement documents, decomposed the requirements into tasks, generated time estimates
for each task, negotiated details of each tasks with the product owner (Dr. Bernstein), and created a product that conformed to
the agreed-upon specifications. Unfortunately, I can't post it here.
