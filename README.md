# My Job Experiences
- **Research Intern**, United States Army Corps of Engineers, Geospatial Research Laboratory; Jun-Aug 2024, Dec 2024-Jan 2025\
As a research intern for USACE's Geospatial Research Laboratory, I worked in a team of 20 members conducting research into the optimization and use of AI models on smartphones for navigation in
  GPS-denied environments.
  
- **Teaching Assistant**, James Madison University Department of Computer Science; Aug 2024-Present\
As a teaching assistant at James Madison University, I provide assistance to professors during their class times, answering questions that students may have. Additionally, I also have office hours on Sundays where students can come in and have their questions answered. As a TA, I have been instructed in teaching methods to help students learn, understand, and comprehend their coursework, not just get the right answer.

# Coursework Projects
- **Fragile**, a mixed fraction calculator; Dec 2023\
Written as a part of CS345, Software Development with Dr. David Bernstein, myself and four other students worked together in a team to write Fragile. Written in Java utilizing Swing for GUI development, my team utilized the Scrum methodology, splitting our work into three two-week sprints. During the sprints, we decomposed requirements into tasks, provided time estimates, distributed the work among the team members, and met with the product manager (Dr. Bernstein) to negotiate the specifics of tasks. Personally, I worked on GUI elements, taking inputs from the user (specifically allowing the user to create custom keyboard shortcuts), custom layouts tailored for specific companies, and the saving and loading of program settings via serialization/de-serialization.

- **y86 Emulator**, an emulator of the fictional y86 architecture written in C; May 2024\
Written as a part of CS261, Computer Systems 1 with Dr. Mohamed Aboutabl, I wrote a program emulating a CPU implementing the fictional y86 architecture. During the course of this project, I implemented the fetch-decode-execute-update-writeback cycle implemented in modern CPU architectures. Written in four parts, my emulator could read CPU instructions as bytes from a file and execute them.

- **Unnamed Hotel Management Database**, a database with a webapp frontend written using PostgreSQL and Python; May 2024\
Written as a part of CS374, Databases with Dr. Chris Mayfield, I worked in a team with three other students to create a database and webapp for a fictional hotel chain. The frontend webapp was written in Python using Flask, and the database was implemented in PostgreSQL. During the course of the project, my team and I elicited the requirements of the database, created an ERD diagram for the database, created the databases, populated them with information, and then created the webapp to fulfill a wide variety of tasks related to the system.
